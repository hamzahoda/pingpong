# Pong by Hamza
This is a simple game of Pong created using Python and Turtle graphics. The game allows two players to play against each other, player A and player B, using the keys W and S to move player A's paddle and the Up and Down arrows to move player B's paddle.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Python [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installing
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install turtle

## Running the Game
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the game by simply executing the script in your terminal using the following command:
